LiHua: Did you see the poster saying that our town is holding a local music festival? It looks like it can be an opportunity for our band to perform in front of the crowd!
WolfgangSchulz: Wow! Sounds like a great opportunity for the band! I think we can prepare for this event! Just a reminder though, I'd prefer we keep it to Sundays for practice since my week is pretty packed. Let’s make the most of our Sunday jam sessions! What do you think?
LiHua: Yeah, Sundays work perfectly! Maybe we can plan to meet earlier than usual to go over some new songs? I'm super excited about the local music festival coming up!
WolfgangSchulz: I'm all in for that! Meeting earlier sounds good. We can prep some new stuff and make sure we're tight for the festival. Let's pick a song list for Sunday!
LiHua: Absolutely! We should focus on some crowd-pleasers. How about we include "Sweet Home Alabama" and throw in something fresh? Maybe Yuriko can pick a bass-heavy track too! 
WolfgangSchulz: Great idea! "Sweet Home Alabama" is a must. And yes, let Yuriko suggest something! I’ve been eager to work on some new material. Can't wait for Sunday!
LiHua: Let’s finalize our list before Sunday then! Should we touch base with Yuriko about her track? 
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, let’s do that! I’ll message Yuriko to get her input. Looking forward to it!
