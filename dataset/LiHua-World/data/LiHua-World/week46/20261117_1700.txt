LiHua: Hey Thane, do you have any tips for relieving eye soreness after long gaming sessions? I've been feeling it lately. Thanks!
ThaneChambers: For sure! ðŸ˜‚ Try taking regular breaks, like the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 mins, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Also, don't forget to blink more. Hydration helps too! ðŸ¥¤ Your eyes will thank you!
LiHua: Got it! I'll definitely try the 20-20-20 rule and make sure to drink more water. Appreciate the tips!
ThaneChambers: No problem! Happy to help. Just remember, your gaming skills matter too, so take care of those eyes while youâ€™re slaying in games! ðŸ‘¾âœ¨
LiHua: Haha, definitely! I'll keep that in mind while diving into "Black Myth: Wukong" later. Thanks again!
ThaneChambers: Sounds awesome! Enjoy "Black Myth: Wukong," the visuals are just insane! Let me know how you like it after your session! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥
LiHua: Will do! I'm really looking forward to it!
