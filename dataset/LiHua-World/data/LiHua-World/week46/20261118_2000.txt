ChaeSong-hwa: Hey guys! I'm thinking about mixing in some Chinese elements into our music and performance style!
WolfgangSchulz: That sounds cool! Mixing in some Chinese elements could really give our sound a unique twist. Have any of you thought about specific instruments or styles we should explore? ðŸŽ¶
YurikoYamamoto: I'm totally on board with that! Maybe we could incorporate some traditional Chinese instruments like the erhu or guzheng? It might add a really nice texture to our music. What do you all think?
