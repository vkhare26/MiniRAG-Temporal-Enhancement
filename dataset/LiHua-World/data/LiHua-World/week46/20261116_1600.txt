AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! Just checking in, what size fridge are you thinking of getting? Also, when are you free to hit the electronics store together?
LiHua: Hey Adam! I'm looking for a standard size, maybe around 18-20 cubic feet? As for timing, I'm free this Thursday afternoon if that works for you!
AdamSmith: Sounds good! Thursday afternoon it is. We can figure out the best options then. Let me know what time works for you!
LiHua: How about we meet at 2 PM? That should give us plenty of time to check things out. 
AdamSmith: Perfect, 2 PM it is! Looking forward to it!
