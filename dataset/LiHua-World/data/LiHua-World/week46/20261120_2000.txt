LiHua: Hey Jennifer! Quick question about my protein powder intake. How much should I be consuming daily to really support my fitness goals?
JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua! Generally, a good rule of thumb is to aim for about 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight, especially if youâ€™re training hard. Just remember to factor in the protein you get from food too! ðŸ’ªðŸ¥—
LiHua: Got it! So if I'm aiming for that range, should I adjust my protein powder servings accordingly? How do I balance it with my meals?
JenniferMoore: Yeah, exactly! You can use protein powder to fill any gaps in your diet. If youâ€™re getting enough protein from meals, you might only need a scoop post-workout or as a snack. Just listen to your body! ðŸ’¥
LiHua: Thanks, Jennifer! That helps a lot. I'll keep track of my meals and adjust as needed. Appreciate your guidance!
JenniferMoore: Anytime, Li Hua! Keep up the great work! If you have more questions, I'm here for you. ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Š
