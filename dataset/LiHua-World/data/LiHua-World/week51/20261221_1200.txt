LiHua: Chae, you think we can also add some cool rhythms? I'm ready to get creative!
ChaeSong-hwa: Absolutely! I love the idea of mixing in some cool rhythms. Itâ€™ll make our sound even more exciting! Canâ€™t wait to see how it turns out!
YurikoYamamoto: Yes! It's going to be so fun. I'm looking forward to our practice this week! ðŸŽ‰
ChaeSong-hwa: Just a reminder to share voice notes or recordings so Wolfgang can join in remotely! Would love to keep him in the loop!
