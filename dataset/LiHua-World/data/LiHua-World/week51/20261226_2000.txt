YurikoYamamoto: Hey Li Hua! Check out this interesting article about how babies learn to talk!
LiHua: Yeah, I just read it! That's amazing!
YurikoYamamoto: It's super interesting how babies pick up language, right? They start with sounds and babbling, which is basically their way of exploring. It’s like they’re playing with the melody of words before they even know what they mean! 🍼✨
LiHua: Totally! It's wild how much they're absorbing without us even realizing it. Their brains are like little sponges! I love how they can mimic sounds even before they really talk. Makes you appreciate the whole learning process! 🌟
YurikoYamamoto: Exactly! And it's amazing how music plays a role in that too. It helps with rhythm and sound patterns, which can make a difference in language development. That's why I love incorporating music into my therapy sessions. 🎶💖
LiHua: That's so cool! Music really does have such a powerful impact. I'm sure the kids enjoy it too! It's a fun way to learn and connect. Have you noticed any particular songs that work really well? 🎸
YurikoYamamoto: Yeah, I've found that simple, repetitive songs catch their attention! Nursery rhymes are great since they have catchy melodies and rhythms. It keeps them engaged while they learn new words. Plus, we always end up having fun! 🎤😊
LiHua: Sounds like a blast! Those songs bring back such great memories. It must be rewarding to see them light up when they learn something new. You're doing some meaningful work! 🌟
YurikoYamamoto: Thank you! It truly is rewarding. Watching their progress and seeing them find their voice is the best part of my job. It’s what keeps me motivated every day! 💕🌈
