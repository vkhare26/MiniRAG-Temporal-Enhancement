Rosemary focaccia sounds amazing! I’ll definitely think about it. Maybe I’ll give it a shot next week! Do you recommend any good toppings for it?
HaileyJohnson: You're welcome! I'm so glad to hear that! 🌟

For the rosemary focaccia, you can't go wrong with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt. You could also top it with some cherry tomatoes or olives for an extra burst of flavor! Let me know if you want to give it a try! 😋
LiHua: That sounds delicious! I love the idea of adding cherry tomatoes. I’ll definitely consider that! Thanks for the tips! 🍅✨

Looking forward to enjoying it next week! Hope you have a great day!
