LiHua: Hey Adam, hope you're doing well! I just wanted to check if there were any issues in the basement after those rainstorms. I want to make sure everything's okay down there. Thanks!
AdamSmith: Hi Li Hua! Everything seems fine in the basement after the rain. Just keep an eye on it, and let me know if you notice anything unusual. If any issues pop up, Iâ€™ll get the maintenance worker to check it out. 
LiHua: That's great to hear! I'll keep an eye out, thanks for the reassurance. Let me know if you need anything from me!
AdamSmith: No problem! Just reach out if you need anything. Also, if you want, I can give you the contact for the maintenance worker in case you see any issues.
LiHua: That would be helpful, thanks! Just in case anything comes up, better to be prepared!
AdamSmith: The contact number for the maintenance worker is 314159. Feel free to reach out if you need any maintenance done. 
LiHua: Thanks a lot! I'll save that number just in case. Appreciate your help!
