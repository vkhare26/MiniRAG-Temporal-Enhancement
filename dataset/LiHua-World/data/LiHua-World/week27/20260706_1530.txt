WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Hope you're doing well. I just found this new coffee shop that's super quiet, perfect for working or chilling out. Wanna grab a coffee there sometime? Let me know!
LiHua: That sounds awesome! I could really use a chill spot since the garden project is making my place a bit noisy. What's the name of the coffee shop?
WolfgangSchulz: The name of the coffee shop is "Across the Stars".
LiHuaï¼šGot it! That's a beautiful name for a coffee shop. When are you thinking?
WolfgangSchulz: How about this weekend? Saturday or Sunday works for me. What do you think?
LiHua: This weekend sounds great! Iâ€™m good for either day, just let me know what works best for you.
WolfgangSchulz: Let's do Saturday then! Looking forward to it! ðŸ˜Š
LiHua: Can't wait! It'll be nice to catch up. ðŸŒŸ
