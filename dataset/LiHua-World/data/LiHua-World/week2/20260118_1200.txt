LiHua: Hey! Can’t wait for tonight! I’ve got some awesome dishes cooking up. You’re gonna love it! 🎉🥢 What time do you think you’ll be able to come over?
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds amazing! I’ll aim to be there around 6. Can’t wait to celebrate with you! Do you need any help with anything? 🎊
LiHua: Awesome, 6 it is! Just bring yourself and your appetite! 😄 Everything else is under control. Got any plans for after dinner?
WolfgangSchulz: Not really, just enjoying the festivities with good food and company sounds perfect. Maybe we could play some games or watch something afterward? 🎮🎥 What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds like a blast! I'm down for some games or a movie after dinner. Got any favorites in mind? 🎬✨
WolfgangSchulz: How about we check out that new movie everyone's talking about? Or we could fire up some classic multiplayer games for nostalgia. Your call! 😊
LiHua: Both sound great! Let’s do the movie first and then switch to games later! I’ll get the snacks ready! 🍿😄
WolfgangSchulz: Perfect combo! I'll bring some drinks to go with your snacks. Looking forward to a fun night! 🥳 See you soon!
LiHua: Can’t wait! This is gonna be such a fun night! See you soon! 🎉
