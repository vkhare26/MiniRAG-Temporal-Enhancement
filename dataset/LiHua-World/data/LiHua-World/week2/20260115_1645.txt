LiHua: Hey! I'm starting a new workout routine and could use some advice on a healthy meal plan. Any tips? 😊
JenniferMoore: That’s awesome you’re starting a new routine! 💪 For a balanced meal plan, focus on whole foods. Include lean proteins (like chicken, fish, tofu), whole grains (like quinoa or brown rice), lots of veggies, and healthy fats (like avocados or nuts). 

Try to eat every 3-4 hours to keep your energy up and make sure to hydrate! If you want, I can help you create a more specific plan based on your preferences. 🍽️✨
LiHua: Thanks for the tips! I'm definitely into lean proteins and veggies. If you have any specific meal ideas or recipes, I'd love to hear them! 😄
JenniferMoore: Sure thing! Here are a few easy meal ideas:

1. **Breakfast:** Scrambled eggs with spinach and tomatoes on whole-grain toast.
2. **Lunch:** Grilled chicken salad with mixed greens, cucumbers, and a vinaigrette.
3. **Snack:** Greek yogurt with a handful of nuts and some berries.
4. **Dinner:** Baked salmon with quinoa and steamed broccoli.

You can mix and match these based on what you like! Let me know if you want more ideas or have any specific ingredients in mind! 🍳🥗🐟
LiHua: These sound delicious! I'll definitely give them a try. I'm excited to see how my new routine and meals work together. Thanks for your help! 🤩
JenniferMoore: You got it! Stick with it, and I’m here if you have any more questions or need support along the way. You've got this! 💥🙌
