JakeWatson: Hey Li Hua! I wanna pass you some advice to avoid offside as a forward on the field. So, to avoid being offside, always try to time your runs. Look at the defenders and make sure to start your sprint just as the ball is played. Staying level with the second-to-last defender is key. Also, keep an eye on your teammates' positioning. Practice makes perfect! Keep it up! ⚽💪
LiHua: Thanks for the tips, Jake! I'll definitely work on my timing and positioning. Can't wait to hit the field and put this practice into action! ⚽🏼
JakeWatson: Awesome! Let me know when you want to practice together. It'll be fun, and I can help you out more in real-time! 😄👍
LiHua: For sure! I'm looking forward to it. Just let me know when you're free!
JakeWatson: How about this weekend? We could meet Saturday afternoon! Let me know if that works for you. 🙌⚽
LiHua: Saturday sounds great! I'm excited to practice with you. What time do you have in mind?
JakeWatson: How about 3 PM? We’ll have plenty of daylight to practice! What do you think?
LiHua: 3 PM works perfectly for me! Looking forward to it! ⚽💥
JakeWatson: Sweet! It’s going to be awesome. I’ll bring some cones and water too. See you on Saturday! 😄👟
