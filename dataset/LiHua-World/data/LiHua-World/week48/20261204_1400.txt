LiHua: Hey Emily! I'm really into sci-fi shows lately, but I want to explore more options besides Westworld. Got any recommendations? ðŸ˜Š
EmilyBurnett: You should definitely check out "Black Mirror"! It's a bit dark but super thought-provoking. Each episode is like a mini movie with its own story. Also, "The Expanse" is amazing if you like space adventures. So good! ðŸš€
LiHua: Thanks for the suggestions! I've heard a lot about "Black Mirror" and I've been meaning to start "The Expanse". Can't wait to dive into them! ðŸ˜Š Do you have a favorite episode from "Black Mirror"?
EmilyBurnett: Honestly, it's tough to choose, but "San Junipero" is definitely a standout for me. It's both beautiful and emotional. How about you? Have you seen any episodes yet?
LiHua: Not yet! Iâ€™m excited to binge-watch it all soon. I'll let you know what I think of "San Junipero" once I watch it! Do you usually prefer watching shows alone or with someone?
EmilyBurnett: I love watching with friends! It's so much fun to share reactions and theories. Plus, you can talk about all those wild plot twists together! How do you usually watch?
LiHua: I prefer a mix of both! Sometimes itâ€™s nice to have a solo watch for more focus, but watching with friends adds to the fun, especially for shows with a lot of drama. Got any plans for the weekend?
EmilyBurnett: Iâ€™m thinking of having a little TV marathon! Might finally finish "The Mandalorian" too. What about you? Any binge-watching plans?
LiHua: Iâ€™ll probably catch up on some shows and maybe play some video games too! Balancing both sounds like a good plan. Enjoy your marathon! ðŸ˜Š
