AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! Thereâ€™s a neighborhood potluck dinner on Wednesday at 6 PM. Would you like to bring a dish to share? It'll be a great way to meet some neighbors!
LiHua: Hey Adam! That sounds awesome! I'd love to contribute. I can whip up some homemade pasta salad. Does that work for you?
AdamSmith: That sounds delicious! I'm sure everyone will enjoy it. Do you need any kitchen supplies or anything from my side?
LiHua: Thanks, Adam! I think I have everything I need. Just need to pick up some fresh ingredients tomorrow. Really looking forward to the potluck!
AdamSmith: Great to hear! Iâ€™m looking forward to it too. Let me know if you need any help. Enjoy making the salad!
LiHua: Will do! Thanks for the offer, Adam! See you on Wednesday! ðŸŒŸ
