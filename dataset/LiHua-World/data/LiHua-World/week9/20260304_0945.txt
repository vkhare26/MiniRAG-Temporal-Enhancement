AdamSmith: Just wanted to remind you about the community garden cleanup event this Saturday. Are you able to bring any gardening tools along?
LiHua: Thanks for the reminder! I'm not sure I can make it this time, so I wonâ€™t bring any tools.
AdamSmith: No worries! If you change your mind or need help with anything, just let me know. Hope you can join us in the future!
LiHua: Sure thing! I appreciate it. I hope it goes well!
AdamSmith: Thanks! We're looking forward to it. Enjoy your week!
