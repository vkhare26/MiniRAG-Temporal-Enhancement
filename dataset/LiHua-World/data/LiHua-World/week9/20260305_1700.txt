LiHua: Hey! Yeah, I’ve definitely noticed some improvements. I feel like I have more stamina during workouts and I'm really enjoying the sessions! The current plan is working well for me. Thanks for your guidance! How’s everything on your end?
JenniferMoore: That's awesome to hear! I'm so glad you're feeling more stamina and enjoying the sessions. 😊 Everything's great here! Just excited to keep pushing you to achieve even more. Any specific goals or areas you want to focus on next? 💥
LiHua: I'm thinking of focusing a bit more on increasing my strength and maybe some flexibility too! I feel like those areas could use some work. Any suggestions on how to approach that?
JenniferMoore: Definitely! For strength, we can incorporate more resistance training into your routine. As for flexibility, adding some dedicated stretching or yoga sessions would really help. We can tweak your current plan to include those. Sound good? 🏋️‍♂️🧘‍♂️
