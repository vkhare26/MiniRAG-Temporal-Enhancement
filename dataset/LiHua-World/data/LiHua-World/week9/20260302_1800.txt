WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Got an extra ticket for a concert on March 7th at 6 PM. Wanna join me? Would be awesome to catch up and enjoy some live music!
LiHua: That sounds amazing! I'm totally in! Can't wait! 🎶 
WolfgangSchulz: Awesome! It'll be a great time. I could use a break from all the coding. Got any favorite bands performing?
LiHua: Not sure about the lineup, but I’m always up for discovering new music! Let’s see what surprises they have for us! 🎸✨ 
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds good! Always fun to explore new music together. Let’s make a plan for the day, maybe grab some food before the concert?
LiHua: Definitely! A pre-concert meal sounds perfect. Do you have a place in mind, or should we try somewhere new? 🍔🎤
WolfgangSchulz: How about we try that new place on Main St? I've heard good things about it! Plus, it’s not too far from the venue. What do you think?
LiHua: Sounds great! I’m always up for checking out new spots. Looking forward to it! 🥳 
WolfgangSchulz: Perfect! It'll be a fun night. Can't wait to enjoy some good food and music together! 🎶
