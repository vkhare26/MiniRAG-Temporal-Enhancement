LiHua: So, Chae, do you play any instruments or have any hobbies? It'd be cool to know more about what you enjoy! 🎶
ChaeSong-hwa: I love singing and used to be in a musical club back in college! 🎤✨ I still enjoy warm songs. How about you guys? Any musical interests?
LiHua: That's awesome, Chae! We're all into music here. 🎸🎶 I play guitar and have jam sessions with Wolfgang and Yuriko every Sunday! Yuriko loves playing bass, and Wolfgang used to drum in a band. What kind of music do you like to sing?
YurikoYamamoto: Oh, that's so cool! 🎶 I love a mix of genres, but I really enjoy classic rock and acoustic songs. They have such great melodies! Do you have a favorite song to perform?
YurikoYamamoto: I think classic rock would suit your voice perfectly! 🎤 If you ever want to collaborate on a song or sing together during our jam sessions, I'm totally in!
