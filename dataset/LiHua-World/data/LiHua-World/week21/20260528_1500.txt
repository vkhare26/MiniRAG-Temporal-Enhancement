LiHua: Hey Yuriko! Do you have any tips for dealing with all the noise from the garden project? It’s been really hard to focus on work lately.
YurikoYamamoto: Have you tried using noise-canceling headphones? They can really help. Also, consider setting up a quiet space with soft furnishings to absorb the sound. Music at a low volume might help create a nicer atmosphere too!
LiHua: Thanks for the advice! I’ll definitely look into the headphones and maybe try some cozy setups at home. Music would definitely help make the noise less annoying!
YurikoYamamoto: Glad you found it helpful! Setting that cozy vibe can really change everything. Just make sure the music is something relaxing for you!
LiHua: Absolutely! I've been thinking about creating a small work nook with some plants and soft lighting too. Maybe it'll help me focus better. What do you think?
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds like a great idea! Plants can really improve the vibe and help with concentration. Plus, soft lighting is way easier on the eyes. You'll feel more energized!
LiHua: I can't wait to set it up! Every little change helps, right?
