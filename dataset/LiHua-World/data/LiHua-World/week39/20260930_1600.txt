LiHua: Hey man! Wanna go have hot pot for dinner tonight? Let me know!
WolfgangSchulz: Hot pot sounds perfect! Sichuan is my fave. What time are we thinking?
LiHua: How about 7 pm? That should give us enough time to get ready!
WolfgangSchulz: 7 pm works for me! Can’t wait for all that spicy goodness! 🍲🔥
LiHua: Yeah, me too! Should we pick up some drinks on the way?
WolfgangSchulz: Good idea! Let’s grab some drinks. What do you feel like having?
LiHua: How about some cold beer to go with the hot pot? Sounds like a good combo!
