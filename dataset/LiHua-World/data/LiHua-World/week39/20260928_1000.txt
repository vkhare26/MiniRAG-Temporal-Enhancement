AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua, could you please measure the size of the window in the basement for me? I want to get some curtains made. Thanks!
LiHua: Sure! I'll measure the window and send you the dimensions shortly. Just give me a moment!
AdamSmith: Great! Appreciate it. Looking forward to the details!
LiHua: Just measured it! The window is 150 cm wide and 120 cm high. Let me know if you need anything else!
AdamSmith: Thanks for measuring! That’s super helpful. I’ll take care of the curtains now. Let me know if you need anything in the meantime!
LiHua: No problem! Just let me know when you need me to help with anything else.
