HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua! Just checking in to see how you liked the rosemary focaccia from last week. Did it hit the spot? 🥖🌿
LiHua: Hey Hailey! The rosemary focaccia was amazing! Loved the flavor and the texture. Definitely a hit! Can’t wait to try more! 😋👍
HaileyJohnson: So glad to hear that! I’m always experimenting with flavors. Do you have any other breads or pastries you'd like to try next? 🍞✨
LiHua: I’d love to try some sourdough next! It’s one of my favorites. Also, any chance you make a good cinnamon roll? 😄
HaileyJohnson: I do, actually! My cinnamon rolls are soft and gooey, perfect for a sweet treat. I can add some to your next order. And I’ll get started on the sourdough for you too! How does that sound? 🥐💖
LiHua: Sounds perfect! I can't wait for both. You really know how to make my day better with your baked goods! Thanks a ton! 🙌😊
HaileyJohnson: You’re so sweet! Your support means a lot to me. I’ll get those ready for you! 🎉 Just a reminder, I’ll be delivering your usual order on Friday. Have a great day! 🌟
