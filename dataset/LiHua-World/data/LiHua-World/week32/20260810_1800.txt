AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! Just wanted to check if you’ve had a chance to look over the warranty and maintenance plans for the air conditioner. Let me know if you have any questions!
LiHua: Yeah, I’ve looked it over. Seems decent overall. Got a couple of questions though. When’s a good time to chat about it?
AdamSmith: How about after dinner? I should be free then. Just let me know what works for you!
LiHua: Sounds good! I'll ping you around 8.
AdamSmith: Perfect! Looking forward to it.
