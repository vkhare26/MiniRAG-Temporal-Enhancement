AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! ðŸ˜Š I just remembered that I have a basement where you can practice your musical instruments. If you're interested, I can give you the key. Let me know!
LiHua: Wow, that's awesome! Iâ€™d love to take advantage of that space. When can I grab the key from you? ðŸŽ¸
AdamSmith: Great to hear! You can come by anytime this evening or tomorrow morning to pick up the key. Just let me know what works for you!
LiHua: I can swing by tomorrow morning, around 9am. Does that work for you?
AdamSmith: Perfect! I'll be here at 9am tomorrow. Looking forward to handing over the key! ðŸ˜Š
LiHua: Thanks, Adam! I'm excited to start practicing! See you in the morning! ðŸŒŸ
