LiHua: Hey Wolfgang! 🎉 Guess what? I finally have a basement now where I can play my guitar! Wanna come over and jam together? You can bring your drums! 🎶 Would be awesome to catch up too!
WolfgangSchulz: Hey Li Hua! That sounds amazing! I’d love to come over and play some drums. It’s been way too long since I had a good jam session. What time do you want me to drop by?
LiHua: How about we meet up tomorrow afternoon? Maybe around 3? We can play for a couple of hours and just chill! 😄
WolfgangSchulz: 3 sounds perfect! Looking forward to it! Can't wait to get back behind the drums! 🥁🎶 See you tomorrow!
LiHua: Awesome! See you then! 🎸
