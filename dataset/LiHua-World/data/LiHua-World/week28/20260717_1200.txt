LiHua: Hi, Chae! I just want to say that I was really amazed by your performance in the band last Sunday! Your singing has really leveled up! Those higher pitches are impressive! Have you been putting in some extra practice on your own?
ChaeSong-hwa: Thanks so much! Yeah, I've been trying to squeeze in some singing whenever I can. It really helps! Can't wait for our next jam session!
LiHua: That's awesome to hear! It definitely shows in your performance. Iâ€™m super excited for our next rehearsal! Got any new song ideas in mind?
ChaeSong-hwa: Iâ€™m thinking about bringing in a few more classics for us to try! Maybe some Fleetwood Mac or The Beatles? What do you think?
LiHua: Those are great choices! Fleetwood Mac always adds some nice vibes, and we can never go wrong with The Beatles. Letâ€™s do it! ðŸŽ¶
ChaeSong-hwa: Perfect! I can already imagine how fun itâ€™ll be. Weâ€™ll have a blast! ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¸
LiHua: Totally! Looking forward to it! Donâ€™t forget to warm up those vocal cords before our session! ðŸ˜„ 
ChaeSong-hwa: Definitely! Gotta get the warm-ups right. See you soon!
