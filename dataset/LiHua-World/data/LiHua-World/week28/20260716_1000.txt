LiHua: Hey Adam! I was just wondering if it is possible to add an air-conditioner in the basement? It's getting pretty warm now that summer's here!
AdamSmith: I totally understand! An air-conditioner would be great for the basement. Let me check with the maintenance guy and get back to you.
LiHua: Thanks a lot! I appreciate it! Just let me know when you find out.
AdamSmith: Sure thing! I'll reach out right now. Give me a bit.
LiHua: Sounds good! I'll be waiting for your update.
AdamSmith: I contacted the maintenance worker, and I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from him. Hang tight!
LiHua: Great! Thanks for the quick response.
AdamSmith: No problem! I want you to be comfortable in the space. I'll update you soon!
LiHua: Looking forward to it! Thanks again!
