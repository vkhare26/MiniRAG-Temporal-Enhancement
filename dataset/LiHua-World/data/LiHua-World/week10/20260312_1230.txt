AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! There's a community bake sale this Sunday at 3 PM to support a local charity. It would be great if you could join. Let me know if you’re interested!
LiHua: That sounds fun! I’d love to help out and enjoy some baked goodies. Count me in! 🍰
AdamSmith: Awesome! It'll be a nice way to meet some neighbors too. Looking forward to it!
LiHua: Yeah, it’s always great to connect with the community! Let me know if you need any help setting things up. 😊
AdamSmith: Thanks for the offer! I think we’ll manage, but I’ll reach out if we need an extra hand. Appreciate it!
LiHua: Sounds good! Just give me a shout if you do. See you at the bake sale! 🍪
