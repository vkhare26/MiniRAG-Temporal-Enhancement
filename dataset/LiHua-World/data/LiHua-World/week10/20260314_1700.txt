HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua! It was great meeting you at the bake sale today! 🌟 Just wanted to share that I offer a doorstep delivery service for fresh milk and bread. It’s super convenient, especially for busy days! Would you be interested in trying it out? 🍞🥛
LiHua: Hey Hailey! It was nice meeting you too! Your delivery service sounds awesome, especially since I love fresh bread. I might just take you up on that! How does it work? 😊
HaileyJohnson: That's fantastic to hear! 🎉 It’s pretty simple – just let me know what you’d like, and I'll deliver it right to your doorstep. I use locally sourced ingredients, so you get the freshest quality! You can choose a regular delivery or just order when you need it. Would you like to try something specific for your first order? 🍞✨
LiHua: That sounds perfect! I’d love to try some of that fresh bread. Do you have any recommendations on the best types? Also, how often do you do deliveries? 😊
HaileyJohnson: I’ve got some amazing artisanal sourdough and a chocolate chip brioche that are customer favorites! 🍞🍫 As for deliveries, I can do it a couple of times a week, depending on what you need. I can also arrange a regular schedule for you if that works better! What do you think?
LiHua: Sounds delicious! I’m definitely interested in the sourdough. 😊 Let’s do a trial run and see how often I might need it. Can we set up a delivery for Tuesday? 🥖
HaileyJohnson: Absolutely! I’ll make sure to have a fresh sourdough loaf ready for you on Tuesday. Just let me know your address, and I’ll drop it off! Looking forward to it! 🥰📦
LiHua: Great! My address is 123 Sunny Street. Can't wait for the bread delivery! Thanks a lot, Hailey! 🌟
HaileyJohnson: Got it! I’ll see you on Tuesday at 123 Sunny Street. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, Li Hua! If you ever have any special requests or questions, just let me know. 🥳
