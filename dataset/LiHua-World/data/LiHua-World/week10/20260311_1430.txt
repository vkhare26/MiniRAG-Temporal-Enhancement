LiHua: Hey! Just wanted to let you know that Iâ€™ve already tested the new features about "Automatically schedule available time" on your studioâ€™s homepage. Everything is working smoothly! ðŸ˜Š
YurikoYamamoto: That's great to hear! I'm really looking forward to seeing how it all came together. Do you think it will make scheduling easier for my clients?
LiHua: Absolutely! I think it will make scheduling super convenient for your clients. They'll be able to see available times right away, which should really help. Let me know if you need any more adjustments or have any other ideas!
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds promising! Thanks so much for your hard work. I'm excited to see the final result! Do you have any suggestions for promoting this new feature once it's live?
LiHua: No worries! I suggest showcasing it on your social media platforms and including a short tutorial on how to use it. You could also send out a newsletter to your clients highlighting the new feature. Engaging posts with visuals could definitely attract more attention!
YurikoYamamoto: Thanks for the tips! I'll start working on some posts and the newsletter. I really appreciate your advice! When do you think we can finalize everything?
LiHua: I think we should aim for the end of the week to finalize everything. That way, you'll have plenty of time to promote it before the weekend! Let me know if that works for you.
YurikoYamamoto: Sounds good! Iâ€™ll prepare everything on my end. Thanks again for your help! Looking forward to launching it!
LiHua: Youâ€™re welcome! Excited to see it all come together. Let me know if you need anything else. ðŸ˜Š
