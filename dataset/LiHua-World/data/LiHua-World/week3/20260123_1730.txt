LiHua: Ugh, it's so frustrating! Just when I think I've nailed down a client's requirements, they change everything! It's like a never-ending cycle. ðŸ˜©
WolfgangSchulz: I hear you, that can be really annoying. Just hang in there! Sometimes, it helps to keep the communication open with them. Maybe set clear expectations about changes? You got this!
LiHua: Yeah, good idea! Iâ€™ll try to be more proactive about it. Just wish they could stick to their original ideas, you know? ðŸ˜… It's exhausting!
WolfgangSchulz: Totally get that! It can be draining when things keep shifting. Just remember to take breaks when you need to. Fresh perspectives can really help clear your mind!
LiHua: Thanks for the tip! I definitely need to remember that. Maybe I'll treat myself to a walk or something later. Gotta keep my spirits up! ðŸŒŸ
WolfgangSchulz: That sounds perfect! A walk can really help reset things. Plus, youâ€™ll get a chance to clear your head and maybe even get inspired. Enjoy!
LiHua: Absolutely! I'll definitely do that. Maybe I'll bring my camera too, capture some cool moments! ðŸ“¸ Thanks for always being here to chat!
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds like a great plan! Your photography skills are awesome, so I can't wait to see what you capture. Keep being creative, my friend!
