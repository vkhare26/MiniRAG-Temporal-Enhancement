AdamSmith: Hi Li Hua! Just wanted to let you know that there will be some maintenance work in the building soon. Can you let me know if there are any times you'd prefer to avoid? Thanks!
LiHua: Hey Adam! Thanks for the heads up. Mornings are usually best for me, so it would be great to avoid those if possible. Let me know the schedule when you have it!
AdamSmith: Got it! I'll make a note to avoid mornings for the maintenance. I'll update you with the specific schedule once it's finalized. Thanks for your input!
LiHua: Sounds good! Appreciate it, Adam. Looking forward to the update!
AdamSmith: You're welcome! I'll keep you posted. If you need anything else in the meantime, just let me know.
