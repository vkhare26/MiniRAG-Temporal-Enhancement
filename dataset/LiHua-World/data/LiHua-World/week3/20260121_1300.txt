WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Want to check out "Overwatch 3" tomorrow? Should be fun! 🎬
LiHua: Sounds awesome! I'm totally in! What time are we thinking? 😊
WolfgangSchulz: Great! How about we catch the 7 PM show? Gives us time to grab some food before. 🍕
LiHua: 7 PM works for me! Food first sounds like a plan! Let’s pick a place we both like. Any thoughts? 😄
WolfgangSchulz: How about that new burger place near the cinema? I've heard good things! 🍔
LiHua: That sounds delicious! I've been wanting to try it. Let’s do it! See you tomorrow! 🍔🎥
