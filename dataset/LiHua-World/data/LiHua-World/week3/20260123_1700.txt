WolfgangSchulz: Hey! How about grabbing some dinner tonight? I know a nice place we could check out!
LiHua: Hey! Thanks for the invite, but I've been super busy lately. Let's plan for another day?
WolfgangSchulz: No problem, I totally understand. Just let me know when you're free! Want to do something low-key this weekend, maybe?

WolfgangSchulz: That sounds perfect! A movie or just chilling at a cafe would be awesome. We can figure out the details later!
