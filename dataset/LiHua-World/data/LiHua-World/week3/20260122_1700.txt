WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Just a reminder about our movie night later. Dinner is at that new burger place near the cinema at 7. Can't wait! 🍔🎬
LiHua: Sounds perfect! I'm looking forward to those burgers! What time do you want to meet?
WolfgangSchulz: Let’s meet around 6:30? That way, we’ll have enough time to grab a bite before the show. 😄
LiHua: 6:30 it is! I’ll be ready and hungry by then! 🍔😋 Got any favorite burger toppings you're craving?
WolfgangSchulz: I'm all about classic cheeseburger vibes! Just keep it simple with lettuce, tomato, and some pickles. What about you?
LiHua: I'm thinking of trying something adventurous! Maybe a spicy jalapeño burger or something with BBQ sauce! 🥵🔥 Can't wait to dig in!
WolfgangSchulz: That sounds awesome! A little spice never hurt anyone. We'll have to share a bite to compare! See you soon! 😄
