LiHua: Hey Jennifer! Just checking in to see if you have any extra exercises I can do at home to complement my training schedule. Would love to maximize my progress! Thanks! ðŸ˜Š
JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua! Absolutely! Here are a few exercises you can do at home: 

1. Bodyweight squats - great for leg strength.
2. Plank holds - excellent for core stability.
3. Push-ups - works your chest, arms, and core.
4. Lunges - awesome for balance and leg strength.
5. Glute bridges - fantastic for your glutes and lower back.

Try to aim for 3 sets of 10-15 reps for each exercise. You got this! ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Š Let me know if you have any questions!
LiHua: Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely include those in my routine. Do you think I should do them on off days or mix them in with my training?
JenniferMoore: It's great you're enthusiastic about adding them in! You can mix them into your training days for a boost or do them on your off days for active recovery. Just listen to your body! If you feel fatigued, stick to lighter sets or just focus on stretching and mobility work. Balance is key! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’ª  Let me know how it goes!
LiHua: Got it! Iâ€™ll find a good balance. Thanks again for your help! Looking forward to our next session! 
JenniferMoore: Youâ€™re welcome! Canâ€™t wait to see your progress! Keep pushing yourself and stay motivated. ðŸ™Œ See you soon!
