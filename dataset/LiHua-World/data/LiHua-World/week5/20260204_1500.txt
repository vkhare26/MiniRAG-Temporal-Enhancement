LiHua: Hey Jennifer! Thanks for understanding my situation. So do you think we can change a training plan? That would really help me balance work and fitness better. Let me know what you think!
JenniferMoore: Absolutely, I can adjust the schedule for you! How about training twice a week instead? We can focus on efficiency and intensity to make the most of our sessions. Let me know if that works for you!
LiHua: That sounds great! I'm all in for twice a week. Just let me know what days work best for you, and Iâ€™ll lock it in my calendar. Thanks a lot for being flexible!
JenniferMoore: Perfect! How about we do Tuesdays and Thursdays? That way, you get a solid rhythm going without it interfering too much with your work. Let me know if that suits you!
LiHua: Tuesdays and Thursdays work perfectly for me! Looking forward to our sessions and making the most out of them. Thanks again for your help!
JenniferMoore: You got it! Iâ€™m excited too! Together, we'll crush those goals! If you have any questions or need anything, just give me a shout. ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Š
