AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! Just wanna ask you if you have received the curtains!
LiHua: Yep, I have received it yesterday! Thanks so much, Adam! And by the way, I really like the patterns!
AdamSmith: Awesome! Glad to hear you like the patterns. Just let me know when you're ready, and I’ll help you with the installation.
LiHua: Thanks, I appreciate it! How about we set a time this week to install it together? 
AdamSmith: Sure, I’m free most evenings. Let me know what works for you!
LiHua: How about this Wednesday at 5 pm? Does that work for you?
