LiHua: Hey Hailey! Your bread and milk are seriously amazing! 😋 Do you think you could send me some bread twice a week, like Mondays at 8am and Fridays at 8am? That would be awesome!
HaileyJohnson: Thanks so much for the love! 💖 I’ll definitely set you up for Monday and Friday deliveries at 8am. Fresh bread and milk will be waiting for you! 🥖🥛 Can’t wait!
