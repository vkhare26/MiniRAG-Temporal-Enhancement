HaileyJohnson: Just wanted to let you know that I left a fresh sourdough loaf at your doorstep! 🥖 Also, as a little thank you for being a new customer, I've included a bottle of milk too! Enjoy! 🥛✨
LiHua: Thanks for the heads up! Can’t wait to try the sourdough! Your bread is the talk of the neighborhood! 🍞🥰 
HaileyJohnson: So glad to hear that! I really hope you enjoy it. If you have any favorites or want to try something special next time, just let me know! 😊💖
LiHua: I’ll definitely keep that in mind! Do you have any recommendations for what I should try next? 🍞✨
HaileyJohnson: Absolutely! If you like something a bit sweet, my honey oat bread is a hit! And if you're feeling adventurous, my rosemary focaccia is a must-try! 🌿🥖 Let me know what sounds good!
LiHua: Both sound amazing! I’ll have to think about it! By the way, when do you usually bake? Just curious! 🍞😊
HaileyJohnson: I start baking super early, usually around 4 AM! That way everything is fresh and ready for the day. If you ever want to come by and see the process, just let me know! 🌅👩‍🍳
LiHua: That sounds like a unique experience! I might take you up on that offer sometime. Thanks again for the bread and milk! You're awesome! 🙌🍞✨
HaileyJohnson: You're so welcome! I'm glad to have you as a customer. Looking forward to seeing you at the bakery soon! Have a great day! 💖🥐
