LiHua: Hey! What do you think about playing "Wonderwall" this Sunday? I feel like it would be a fun jam! 🎸
WolfgangSchulz: "Wonderwall" sounds great! It’ll be awesome to groove to that one together. How about mixing it up with “Hey Jude” too?
LiHua: "Hey Jude" is a classic! I love that idea. We could really get into it and have a good time. Any other songs you're thinking about?
WolfgangSchulz: How about we throw in "Come Together" as well? I think it would be a nice addition to our set! 🥁
LiHua: "Come Together" would definitely add some cool vibes! I'm all in for that. Let’s make this Sunday a blast! 🎶
WolfgangSchulz: Can't wait! It’s gonna be a fun night. Let’s nail down the parts we want to focus on before then. 🎤
LiHua: Good plan! We can go over the key parts and figure out our roles. It’ll make the practice smoother. See you Sunday! 🎸🙌
