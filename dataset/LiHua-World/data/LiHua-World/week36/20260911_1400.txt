ThaneChambers: Hey Li Hua! 🎮 Are you up for some shopping together this weekend? Just saw that the local game store has some killer discounts on PS5 games! Let me know! 😊
LiHua: Sounds awesome! I'm definitely in! What time were you thinking? 🕒
ThaneChambers: Great! How about Saturday around noon? We can grab lunch afterward too! 🍔 
LiHua: Noon works for me! Can't wait to see what games we find. Lunch sounds good too! 😄
ThaneChambers: Awesome! It'll be a fun day! If you have any games in mind, let me know! 🎉
LiHua: I’ve got my eye on a few! Maybe we can check if they have "Spider-Man: Miles Morales" and something new. Got any suggestions? 🕷️
ThaneChambers: Totally! "Spider-Man: Miles Morales" is a great choice! I'd also suggest checking out "Demon's Souls" if you haven't tried it yet. It's challenging but super rewarding! 🔥
LiHua: Nice! I've heard a lot about "Demon's Souls". I might give it a shot! Looking forward to our shopping spree! 🛍️
ThaneChambers: It's gonna be epic! Can’t wait to see what treasures we find! Let’s make this weekend a blast! 🙌
