WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Just wanted to share that my software project finally made some significant progress! 🎉 Thanks a ton for your encouragement during the hard times, it really helped me push through! 🙏 How's everything with you?
LiHua: That's awesome to hear! I'm really proud of you! 🎉 Things are going well, just trying to juggle work and gym. Got a session with Jennifer this Thursday. How's the project looking now?
WolfgangSchulz: Thanks for the support! The project is looking much better now, all the pieces are finally coming together. Can't wait to see what we can do in our next jam session! Are you still practicing that new song on the guitar?
LiHua: For sure! I've been working on "Blackbird" and "Hotel California" lately. Trying to get better with my strumming. 🎸 Can't wait for our Sunday jam! You bringing the energy as always?
WolfgangSchulz: Definitely! Can't wait to vibe with you all again. It's always a blast playing with the band. 🎶 Just a few more days till we rock it out! 
LiHua: Right? It feels like the best part of the week! 😄 By the way, do you have any new songs in mind for us to try? 
WolfgangSchulz: I've been thinking about "Come Together" and maybe "Here Comes the Sun" again! They sound awesome when we play them as a group. What do you think?
LiHua: I love those choices! "Come Together" has that great groove, and "Here Comes the Sun" always lifts the mood. 🌞 Let's definitely give them a shot! 
WolfgangSchulz: Sweet! Looking forward to it! Let’s make it an epic session! See you Sunday! 🎵
LiHua: Absolutely! Can't wait! See you then! 🎸
