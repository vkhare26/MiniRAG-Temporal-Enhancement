AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! Hope you're doing well. Just wanted to check in and see how the basement held up after the storm. Any issues with water leakage? Let me know!
LiHua: Hey Adam! The basement is all good, no water leakage at all. Just a bit damp, but nothing major. Thanks for checking in!
AdamSmith: That's great to hear! Glad there's no leakage. If you need anything or decide to use the basement for storage, just let me know. Cheers!
LiHua: Thanks, Adam! I appreciate it. If I need anything, Iâ€™ll definitely reach out. Hope you have a great day!
AdamSmith: You too, Li Hua! Take care!
