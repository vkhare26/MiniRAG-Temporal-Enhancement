LiHua: Hey Jake! Just want to ask your opinion about the best midfielder in the past decade since you're such an experienced soccer fan!
JakeWatson: Oh, I think it’s gotta be Luka Modrić! His vision and passing ability are just unreal. Plus, he helped Croatia reach the finals in the World Cup! What do you think?
LiHua: Yeah, Modrić is a beast! But I think Kevin De Bruyne is right up there too. His ability to create chances and his pinpoint passes are game-changing. It's tough to choose just one!
JakeWatson: Absolutely! De Bruyne is incredible as well. He's such a game-changer for City too. It’s awesome watching him play. Who else do you think deserves a mention in that conversation?
LiHua: N'Golo Kanté can't be overlooked either! He's all over the pitch, winning tackles and breaking up play. His work rate is phenomenal, and he’s been key for Chelsea and the French national team. 
JakeWatson: Totally agree! Kanté brings so much energy and balance to the midfield. His ability to win the ball back is impressive. It’s interesting how different styles can impact a game!
