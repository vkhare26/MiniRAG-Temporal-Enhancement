LiHua: Hey Yuriko! After our meeting this afternoon, I feel like your requests for the studio's homepage improvements are pretty straightforward. I can definitely wrap it up in about 2 weeks. Looking forward to getting started!
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds great, Li Hua! I really appreciate your help. Excited to see what you come up with! 😊
LiHua: Thanks! I'm excited too! If you have any more ideas or changes while I'm working on it, just let me know. Happy to incorporate anything you think of!
YurikoYamamoto: Definitely, I'll keep that in mind! I'm sure your touch will make it even better. Just let me know if you need anything from my side too! 🎶
LiHua: Will do! I’ll reach out if I have any questions. Also, if you want to grab a coffee and brainstorm more ideas, just hit me up!
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds like a fun idea! I’d love to chat more over coffee. Just let me know when you’re free! ☕️
LiHua: Perfect! Let’s plan for next week then. I’ll check my schedule and text you later. Looking forward to it!
