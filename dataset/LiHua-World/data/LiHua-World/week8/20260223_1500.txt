YurikoYamamoto: Hey Li Hua! ðŸ˜Š It was great meeting you at the freelancer gathering today! I was wondering if you could help me with improving the homepage of my speech therapy studio. Iâ€™d really appreciate your expertise!
LiHua: Hey! It was nice meeting you too! Iâ€™d love to help with your studio's homepage. Can you share what you have in mind or any specific changes you want? Looking forward to it!
YurikoYamamoto: Thanks so much! I want the homepage to be more welcoming and engaging. Maybe some visuals that reflect the essence of speech therapy? Also, Iâ€™m thinking about including sections for resources and success stories. What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds like a great approach! Visuals would definitely make it more inviting. I can help you find some nice images and layout ideas. Including resources and success stories is also a fantastic idea! Let's brainstorm some more details when we have time. Just let me know when you're available!
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds perfect! Letâ€™s definitely dive deeper into the details. Iâ€™m free most afternoons this week. Just tell me what works for you!
LiHua: How about Thursday afternoon? Iâ€™m usually free after 3 PM. If that works, we can set up a time to discuss everything!
YurikoYamamoto: Thursday after 3 PM works great for me! Iâ€™ll set aside some time so we can go through the homepage ideas together. Looking forward to it!
LiHua: Awesome! Looking forward to our chat. Letâ€™s make your homepage shine!
