LiHua: Hey Jennifer! I'm feeling some soreness in my arm muscles after the workout this week. Can you give me some tips to relieve the soreness?
JenniferMoore: Of course! Remember to do the warm-up stretches I taught you in class and drink plenty of water! That will help with the soreness.
LiHua: Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely try those stretches and stay hydrated. Hopefully, it helps with the soreness. Cheers!
JenniferMoore: You're welcome! Don't forget to also foam roll those arms a bit if you have one. It'll really help with recovery. And rest up! See you next week! ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Š
LiHua: Got it! Iâ€™ll give the foam rolling a go. Thanks again, see you at our next session!
JenniferMoore: Awesome! Looking forward to it! Remember, listen to your body. Take care! ðŸŒŸ
LiHua: Will do! Take care too!
