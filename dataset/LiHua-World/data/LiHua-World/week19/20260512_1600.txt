WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Are you going to that web tech forum this Saturday? I'm thinking of skipping it.
LiHua: Nah, I think I'm gonna pass on that. Not really into it this time. What about you?
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, same here. Just too busy with work and all. Plus, Iâ€™d rather jam with the band on Sunday!
LiHua: Absolutely! I can't wait for our jam session. It's gonna be fun! Did you come up with any new beats or ideas for our songs?
WolfgangSchulz: I've been thinking of some cool rhythms for "Hymn for the Weekend." Maybe we can mix it up a bit! What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds awesome! A fresh twist would be great. I'm excited to try it out together!
