LiHua: Hey! Just moved in, and I need your expert advice. What are the best spots in the city for some epic photos? 📸🌆
WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Welcome to the city! For great photos, you should check out the park by the river. The views are stunning, especially at sunset. Also, don't miss the old town square; there are some amazing buildings there. And if you can, the observation deck has the best city skyline view! 📍✨
