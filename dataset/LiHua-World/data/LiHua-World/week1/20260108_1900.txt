LiHua: Hey Adam! Hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that I accidentally broke a light fixture in the apartment. What should I do about it? Should I get it repaired myself or would you prefer to handle it? Thanks!
AdamSmith: Hi Li Hua, thanks for letting me know. No worries about the fixture. It's best if you don’t try to fix it yourself. I’ll arrange for a professional to take a look at it. I’ll keep you updated. 
LiHua: Sounds good! Thanks for taking care of that. Just let me know if you need anything from me!
AdamSmith: Sure thing! I’ll get back to you once I have more info. Just keep an eye on the area for now. 
LiHua: Got it! I’ll make sure to keep it safe. Appreciate your help!
