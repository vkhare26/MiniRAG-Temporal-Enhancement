LiHua: Hey Adam! Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to ask if it’s possible to get a small repair done on the door hinge? It’s been squeaking quite a bit. Thanks!
AdamSmith: Hi Li Hua! Sure, I can arrange for that repair. Would you prefer a specific time for the maintenance to be done?
LiHua: Thanks, Adam! I’m flexible, so just let me know when works best for the maintenance guy. My schedule's pretty open!
AdamSmith: Great! I’ll coordinate with the repair service and keep you posted. Shouldn't take long to fix.
LiHua: Sounds good! Appreciate it, Adam. Just let me know when they're coming. Cheers!
AdamSmith: You’re welcome! I’ll update you soon. Take care!
