LiHua: Hey Adam! Hope you're doing well. Just wanted to ask for the Wi-Fi password when you get a chance. Also, are there any house rules I should know about? Thanks!
AdamSmith: Sure! The Wi-Fi password is "Family123". 

As for house rules, please keep noise to a minimum during late hours and take good care of the property. Let me know if you have any other questions!
LiHua: Got it, thanks! I'll make sure to keep it down at night. Just one more thing, is it okay to have friends over occasionally?
AdamSmith: You're welcome! Yes, having friends over occasionally is fine, just try to keep the gatherings reasonable. Enjoy!
LiHua: Awesome, appreciate it! Looking forward to settling in.
