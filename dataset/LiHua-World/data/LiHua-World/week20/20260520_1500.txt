LiHua: Hey, Chae! Ugh, the garden renovation is driving me nuts! It's so noisy, I can't concentrate on my work. Do you think it'll be like this for long?
ChaeSong-hwa: That sounds really frustrating! Construction can be super loud and annoying. Hopefully, it won't last too much longer. Maybe they’ll wrap it up soon! Have you thought about working somewhere else for a bit?
LiHua: Yeah, I might need to find a quieter spot. Just trying to figure out a good place nearby. Do you have any suggestions?
ChaeSong-hwa: How about trying out a café or library? They can be pretty chill, and you'll get some inspiration with a change of scenery. Plus, I always find a bit of background noise helps sometimes!
LiHua: Great idea! A café sounds perfect for a change of vibe. Thanks, Chae! I'll check some out. Hope your day is going well despite the noise!
ChaeSong-hwa: Thanks! Staying busy with work but all good on my end. Let me know where you find the best café! 
LiHua: Sure thing! I'll keep you updated. Good luck with your work too!
