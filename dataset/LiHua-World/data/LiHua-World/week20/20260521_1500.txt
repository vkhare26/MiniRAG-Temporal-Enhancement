LiHua: I just discovered "The Lighthouse Cafe"! It's such a chill place to work with some nice jazz playing in the background. Perfect for getting stuff done without all the noise from the garden project. Have you been there?
ChaeSong-hwa: I havenâ€™t been yet, but it sounds great! I could use a cozy spot to unwind after all this surgery chaos. Have you grabbed any of their coffee or snacks?
LiHua: Yeah! Their coffee is awesome, and I tried a pastry there too. Super tasty! Definitely a place to relax. Let me know if you decide to check it out!
ChaeSong-hwa: That sounds amazing! I'm definitely going to try it out soon. A good coffee break will help with all this work stress. Thanks for the recommendation!
LiHua: No problem! I'm glad you found it helpful. Enjoy your break when you make it there!
