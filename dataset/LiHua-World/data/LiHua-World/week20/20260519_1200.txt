WolfgangSchulz: That sounds awesome! Can’t wait to try it. You’ve got good taste, as always! 🍰 When are we thinking about dinner?
LiHua: Let’s aim for this weekend! I’m free on Saturday night. What about you? 😊
WolfgangSchulz: Saturday night works for me! Looking forward to it. We can catch up and enjoy that cheesecake! 🍰
