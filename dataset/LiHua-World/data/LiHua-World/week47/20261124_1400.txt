ThaneChambers: Hey Li Hua, I saw you were online pretty late last night. Just a friendly reminder to not stay up too late playing games, alright? It's easy to lose track of time. Get some good rest! 😊🎮
LiHua: Haha, thanks Thane! I'll try to keep that in mind. The games are just so addictive sometimes! 😅 What have you been playing lately?
