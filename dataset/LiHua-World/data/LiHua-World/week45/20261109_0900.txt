JakeWatson: Hey, man! I remember you were feeling confused about handballs last time. So, handballs in soccer are when a player deliberately touches the ball with their hand or arm. If it happens, the other team gets a free kick. But if it's just accidental, like a player trying to shield themselves, then usually no foul is called. Hope that helps! ‚öΩÔ∏è
LiHua: That's pretty interesting! I guess it's all about being aware of your arms on the pitch, right? I can't wait to learn more rules as I start playing! Any more tips you got?
JakeWatson: For sure! Another thing to remember is the offside rule. A player is offside if they're closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent when the ball is played to them. It can be tricky, but it helps keep the game flowing! Let me know if you want to practice some of this on the field! 
LiHua: Definitely! I want to get a better grasp on those rules in real situations. When do you think we could hit the field together?
JakeWatson: How about this weekend? We could practice some drills and go over the rules while playing. It'll be fun! Let me know what time works for you!
LiHua: Sounds like a plan! How about Saturday afternoon? That way we have plenty of time to practice and enjoy it without rushing. What do you think?
JakeWatson: Saturday afternoon works great for me! We can meet up at the usual spot. Can‚Äôt wait to get you running on the field! üí™‚öΩÔ∏è
LiHua: Sweet! Looking forward to it! Let's make it a good session! üôå
