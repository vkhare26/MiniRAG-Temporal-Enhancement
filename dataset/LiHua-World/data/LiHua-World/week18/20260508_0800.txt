HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua! Just a quick reminder that it's Mother’s Day this weekend! I’ve got a special promotion happening. 🌸 Any plans for celebrations? 🎉
LiHua: Sounds great! What's the promotion about? I might grab something for my landlord too.
HaileyJohnson: I’m offering 15% off all pastries and special cakes for Mother’s Day! Perfect for a treat or a surprise. 🍰❤️ Plus, if you order today, Alice can deliver it fresh to your doorstep. Let me know if you’re interested!
LiHua: That sounds delicious! I think I’ll take advantage of that offer. Can I get a little mix of pastries? What's your top recommendation?
HaileyJohnson: Absolutely! I recommend trying our raspberry-filled croissants and the chocolate eclairs – they’re always a hit! 🥐🍫 How many would you like?
LiHua: I'll take a dozen of each! Can you deliver them to my place around 8 am on Monday? 🎉
HaileyJohnson: Got it! A dozen raspberry croissants and a dozen chocolate eclairs for Monday at 8 am. Thank you so much! Alice will take care of the delivery. Can’t wait for you to try them! 😊
