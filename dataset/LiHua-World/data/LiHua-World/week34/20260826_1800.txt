EmilyBurnett: Hey guys! Let's discuss about the main character Kendall's motivation in the TV series Succession! I think it will be fun to take a close look at him! I will go first!
EmilyBurnett: I think Kendallâ€™s motivations are so complex! It's like heâ€™s trying to prove himself, not just to his dad but also to the world. Plus, I feel like the pressure of the family legacy weighs heavily on him. What do you all think?
Kieran: I find it interesting how Kendallâ€™s struggle for power ties back to his childhood. The constant rivalry and need for approval from Logan really shaped him. Do you think he can ever fully break free from that dynamic?
Tamara: Totally agree! His relationship with Logan is so toxic, but Kendall keeps coming back for more validation. It's like heâ€™s in this endless cycle. Iâ€™m curious though, do you think there's a chance for reconciliation between them, or is it too far gone?
Orion: Reconciliation seems unlikely at this point! Their bond is so toxic, and Kendall's journey feels more about breaking away than mending things. Plus, the betrayals just keep piling up. Do you think thatâ€™s what drives him to sabotage Logan further?
EmilyBurnett: Definitely! I feel like each betrayal just pushes Kendall deeper into his quest for power. It's almost like heâ€™s trapped in this self-destructive loop. And every time he tries to break away, he ends up back in the same game. So intense!
LiHua: The intensity of Kendall's journey really keeps us on edge! It's hard not to root for him despite everything, especially when you see how hurt he is. What do you think his ultimate goal really is? Just to take over, or is it more about finding his own identity?
Kieran: I really think it's a mix of both! On one hand, he craves that power and validation, but on the other, he seems desperate to carve out his own identity separate from Logan's shadow. It's such an interesting storyline, watching him fight that internal battle. Do you see him ever truly overcoming it?
Lachlan: Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure! The way the show is written, it feels like heâ€™s constantly battling these demons. Maybe heâ€™ll find a moment of clarity, but I think the road to redemption is going to be really tough for him. Do you all think he's capable of real change?
Quillan: I want to believe he can change, but it feels like he's always falling back into old patterns. Maybe if he finds support from other characters, like his siblings or even someone unexpected, he could finally break that cycle. What do you think it would take for him to really change?
LiHua: It would take a lot of self-reflection and maybe a real wake-up call. I feel like he needs to confront not only his family issues but also his own fragile sense of self. A turning point where he recognizes his worth outside of the family drama would be pivotal!
Niamh: Exactly! That kind of self-awareness is crucial for his development. Itâ€™s like he needs to step out of that shadow and realize heâ€™s capable of so much more than just being Logan's son. Itâ€™ll be interesting to see if he gets to that point.
Rowan: If he does make that leap, it could really change the dynamics of the show. I mean, seeing him embrace a different path would be such a game-changer! Do you think weâ€™ll get to see that in the upcoming episodes?
Quillan: I hope so! That kind of transformation would definitely add more depth to his character. It would also shake things up with the family dynamics, which is always fascinating to watch. Iâ€™m excited to see how the writers will handle that!
Saffron: I literally canâ€™t wait to see where they take Kendallâ€™s character next! It feels like heâ€™s at a crossroads, and any direction could lead to some intense drama. Do you all have any predictions for his next move?
Rowan: It feels like heâ€™s teetering on the edge of a big decision. Maybe heâ€™ll team up with a surprising ally to take on Logan? That could really change the game! What do you all think about that possibility?
Merrick: I can totally see that happening! A surprising ally would definitely shake things up. It could create a whole new dynamic and push Kendall to evolve. Plus, it would be super entertaining to watch!
LiHua: It's definitely going to be a wild ride if that happens! The character interactions are always a highlight, and a new alliance could lead to so many unexpected twists. I'm hyped for the next episodes!
Quillan: Iâ€™m right there with you! The tension and unpredictability are what make the show so engaging. I canâ€™t wait to see how the story unfolds, especially for Kendall. Let's see what they have in store for us!
EmilyBurnett: So true! The blend of drama and unpredictability keeps us all hooked. I love how each character's journey is so intertwined with the others. Can't wait for the next episode to drop!

Lachlan: Whatâ€™s everyoneâ€™s favorite character from the show? I think mine has to be Roman for his wit and sarcasm. He adds such a unique flavor to the dynamics! What about you all?
Merrick: I really love Shiv! Sheâ€™s so ambitious and smart, always strategizing her moves. Her character development keeps me on my toes! What do you think about her journey?
Merrick: I think Shiv is super compelling! She balances ambition and vulnerability really well. Plus, her relationship with the family adds so much depth to her character. Itâ€™s cool to see how she navigates that complicated dynamic!
