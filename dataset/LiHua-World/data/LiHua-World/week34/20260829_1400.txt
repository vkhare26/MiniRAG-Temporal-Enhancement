HaileyJohnson: Hey! I'm curious about how sweet my donuts should be. What do you think? Should I make them sweeter or maybe tone it down a bit? 🍩💭
LiHua: Honestly, I think a little less sweet makes them more enjoyable! That way, you can really taste the flavors. But a touch of sweetness is still nice! What do you think?
HaileyJohnson: That sounds like a good balance! I love experimenting with flavors, so I might try reducing the sweetness a bit. Thanks for your input! 😊 
LiHua: No problem! I'm looking forward to trying your new version. You always come up with awesome ideas!
HaileyJohnson: Aww, thank you! Your support means a lot. Can't wait for you to taste the new donuts! 🍩❤️
