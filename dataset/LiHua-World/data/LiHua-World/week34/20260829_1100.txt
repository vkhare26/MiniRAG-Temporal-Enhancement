JakeWatson: Hey Li Hua! How are your legs holding up after our training last week? Any soreness or are you feeling good?
LiHua: Hey! They were a bit sore for a day or two, but now I'm feeling great. Just trying to keep up with the routine. How about you?
JakeWatson: Nice! Glad to hear you're feeling good now. I'm doing well too, just counting down to our next practice! Are you ready for more soccer fun?
LiHua: Oh yeah, I'm totally ready! Can't wait to hit the field again. Do you have any specific drills in mind for us?
JakeWatson: Awesome! I was thinking we could work on some passing drills and maybe practice shooting a bit. What do you think?
LiHua: Sounds perfect! I'm all in for that. It'll be great to sharpen those skills. When are we meeting up?
JakeWatson: How about tomorrow afternoon? Maybe around 3? Let me know what works for you!
LiHua: 3 works for me! Looking forward to it. See you then!
JakeWatson: Sweet! Can't wait to see you on the field. It's gonna be fun!
