LiHua: Hey buddy! I have a fun question to ask you: Do you think the meat patty in a classic American cheese burger should be cooked to medium rare or well-done? 
WolfgangSchulz: I get the point of medium rare, but I think well-done is just safer and more flavorful. Plus, I like a little char on my burger! What do you think?
LiHua: I get that! But I just love the juicy texture of a medium rare patty. That's where all the flavor is for me! üçî What about toppings?
WolfgangSchulz: Toppings can definitely make or break it! I'm all for classic cheese and maybe some bacon. You can't go wrong with that combo! What's your go-to?
LiHua: Oh definitely cheese! But I also like adding jalape√±os for a kick. It‚Äôs the perfect mix of creamy and spicy! Do you like spicy stuff?
WolfgangSchulz: I can handle a bit of spice, but I prefer to keep it mild. I like to enjoy the burger flavor itself, you know? Maybe just a hint of hot sauce if I'm feeling adventurous!
LiHua: Totally understand that! Sometimes simplicity wins. But hey, I'm down for a little experiment every now and then. Want to plan a burger night soon? üçî
WolfgangSchulz: For sure! That sounds awesome. Let's pick a weekend and make it happen!
