LiHua: Hey Thane! I just want to express my love for Witcher 3 again! The more I play this game, the more I'm amazed by the beautiful landscapes in the game!
ThaneChambers: The scenery in Skellige is just breathtaking! The cliffs and the ocean views are next level. What do you think?
LiHua: Totally agree! Skellige is stunning, but I find the landscapes in Toussaint to be equally beautiful, with all those vineyards and castles. Such a vibrant place!
ThaneChambers: Oh yes! Toussaint has that fairy-tale vibe. The colors are incredibly vivid, especially during sunset. Have you explored all the quests there? They're so immersive!
LiHua: Absolutely! The quests there feel like you're part of a storybook. I love how they incorporate the surrounding beauty. Did you have a favorite quest in Toussaint?
ThaneChambers: For sure! The "Blood and Wine" storyline is my fave. It's so rich with lore and the twist at the end is just epic! What about you? Any particular quest that stood out?
LiHua: I really liked the quest where you help the knights in the tournament. The atmosphere and the characters were amazing! Plus, the visuals during that whole event were just perfect.
ThaneChambers: That tournament quest was so fun! The challenges were intense, and the knight characters added a unique touch. Plus, the stunning views of the arena were unforgettable. Makes you really feel like you're in that world!
