AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua, I'm so happy to tell you that I have nailed with the contractor about the details of the air-conditioner! The only thing to go now is the installation!
Li Hua: That sounds absolutely awesome! Thank you so much Adam!
AdamSmith: You're welcome! Just wondering when are you free for the air-conditioner installation? I want to make sure it fits your work schedule. Also, I'll check the contractor's availability to align everything. Let me know!
LiHua: I’m pretty flexible, but I usually work at The Lighthouse Cafe during the day now. Maybe we can schedule it in the afternoon? What do you think?
AdamSmith: Sounds good! I’ll reach out to the contractor and see if they can do it in the afternoon. I’ll keep you updated!
LiHua: Great, appreciate it! Just let me know what the contractor says.
AdamSmith: Will do! I’ll check in with them and get back to you soon. Talk later!
