WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Just got back from the exhibition. Those football stadium photos were something else! So massive and impressive, right? I could just stare at them for ages. What did you think?
LiHua: Totally agree! They really capture the energy and design. I love how each one has its own vibe. Did you have a favorite?
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, the one in Barcelona was stunning! The architecture and the history behind it just blew my mind. How about you? Which one stood out for you?
LiHua: I loved the one from Wembley! The lighting and the atmosphere were on point. Plus, the stories behind famous matches make it even more special!
WolfgangSchulz: Wembley was epic! Those stories really add so much depth. Can't wait to chat more about this in person. Sounds like we should do a mini recap over some music this weekend! 
LiHua: Definitely up for that! It'll be fun to jam and reminisce about the exhibition. What time do you want to meet at the basement?
WolfgangSchulz: Let's stick to our usual 8 pm, sound good? I'm looking forward to it!
LiHua: Perfect! Can't wait to make some music together. See you then!
