WolfgangSchulz: Hey guys, check out this drum cover of "Enter Sandman." 🤘 Thought it might be cool to experiment with some heavier stuff in our setlist! What do you all think?
LiHua: That cover was sick! Can't wait to hear us jam on some heavier songs! It could bring a whole new vibe to our sound! 🎸🔥
WolfgangSchulz: Totally! Imagine us playing something like that together. It's a whole different energy! Would love to see what we can come up with. 
YurikoYamamoto: Yeah, that would be awesome! I think adding some heavier tracks could really shake things up. Let's get creative! 
ChaeSong-hwa: For sure! Heavy tracks could really show off our range. Plus, we all love a good challenge, right? 😄 What do you guys have in mind?
YurikoYamamoto: I agree! Trying out different genres is always fun. Maybe we can pick a couple of popular heavy songs to start with? 🎶
WolfgangSchulz: I like that! We could brainstorm some options later. Let's keep the creativity flowing for our next jam. Just gotta make sure we keep our unique sound too!
ChaeSong-hwa: Absolutely! I'm excited to see what we all come up with. Mixing it up is always a good idea, and I think we can totally make it our own! 🎤✨
ChaeSong-hwa: Maybe we could also try to collaborate on an original song that's a little heavier? Would be exciting to create something fresh together! 
LiHua: That’s a brilliant idea! Writing an original track could showcase our style perfectly! Let’s brainstorm some themes or concepts for it in our next session! 🎶💡
ChaeSong-hwa: Looking forward to it! Let's bring some fresh energy to our next session and see where it takes us! With some brainstorming, it’ll be awesome!
LiHua: I'm in! Can't wait to jam and create something unique together. Let’s keep the vibes good! 🎸✨
LiHua: By the way, we should also plan out our rehearsals since the garden renovation project is still ongoing. It's nice to have a backup plan in place!
YurikoYamamoto: Yeah, good call! We definitely need to figure out a schedule that works. Let’s stay flexible with our space until the renovations are done. 😄
WolfgangSchulz: I’d rather stick with our usual Sunday sessions for now. Busy week ahead, so let's keep it simple! Can't wait for the next jam!
WolfgangSchulz: For sure! Sunday night is our time to shine! Let’s keep some routine while we explore these new ideas! 🎶✨
LiHua: Perfect! Looking forward to it, guys! Let’s keep those creative juices flowing until then! 🎸🎉
YurikoYamamoto: Can't wait to see how it all comes together! It's going to be a great vibe for sure. 
LiHua: Absolutely! Sunday nights are going to be epic! 🎤🎶 Let's make some noise!
YurikoYamamoto: I'm so excited for our next jam! It's going to be so much fun experimenting with new styles together. 🎸✨
