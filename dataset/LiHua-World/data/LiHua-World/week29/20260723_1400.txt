AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! I want to follow up on the air-conditioner stuffs we talked about last time. I think the basement has enough space, so you can choose an air-conditioner that suits your needs. Just let me know the size you prefer, and we can go from there!
LiHua: What are the dimensions we’re working with in the basement? I want to make sure it fits well.
AdamSmith: The basement is approximately 15 feet by 20 feet. You should have plenty of options that fit within those dimensions.
LiHua: That's helpful! Thanks! Do you have any recommendations on which type to pick?
AdamSmith: For the basement, a split-type air-conditioner would be a great choice. It’s efficient and quieter. Just make sure it has enough cooling capacity for the space.
LiHua: Sounds good! I’ll look into split-type air-conditioners with suitable cooling capacity. Thanks for the heads up!
