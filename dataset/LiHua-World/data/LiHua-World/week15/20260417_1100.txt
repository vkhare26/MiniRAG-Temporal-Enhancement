AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! The community garden renovation is coming up, and I’d love to hear your ideas. Anything you think we should add or change?
LiHua: That sounds great! Maybe we could add more seating areas for people to relax and enjoy the space. Some flower beds with native plants could be nice too, to attract more butterflies and bees. What do you think?
AdamSmith: I really like those ideas! Seating areas would definitely make it more inviting, and native plants are a great touch for wildlife. Do you have any specific types of flowers in mind for the beds?
LiHua: How about some lavender or coneflowers? They’re both beautiful and great for pollinators. Plus, they don’t require too much maintenance!
AdamSmith: Lavender and coneflowers sound perfect! They also smell amazing. I’ll make sure to mention this in the next meeting. Any other suggestions you have in mind for the garden?
LiHua: Maybe we could include a small herb section? That way, people can pick fresh herbs for their cooking. It would be nice to have some basil, mint, and rosemary! What do you think?
AdamSmith: That's a fantastic idea! Fresh herbs would definitely make the garden more useful and enjoyable. I'll add that to the list for the meeting too. Thanks for all your input!
