YurikoYamamoto: Hey guys! Just wanted to let you know I have some work to do this Sunday, so I won't be able to join the jam session. Hope you both have a great time! 🎶
LiHua: Ah, bummer! It's always a blast when you're around. What's the plan for this Sunday then, Wolfgang? Should we just go ahead or find another day to meet up?
YurikoYamamoto: Thanks for understanding! I'm sure it'll be fun regardless. Let me know how it goes!
LiHua: Wolfgang, do you have a song in mind for this Sunday? Or maybe we could just pick something fun randomly! 🎵
WolfgangSchulz: We can still play without you, but it'll miss your vibe! We can figure something out for the next one. Let's keep it simple this time. How about sticking to "Hey Jude" since we haven’t played it in a while?
LiHua: Yeah, "Hey Jude" is a classic! It’ll still be fun! We can jam and try to get some good recordings too. Let’s make it a good one! 🎸
WolfgangSchulz: For sure! Let's make the best of it and rock it out! 🎵✨ 
WolfgangSchulz: Yuriko, hope your work goes well! Catch you next time! 🥁
YurikoYamamoto: Thanks, I appreciate it! I'll be looking forward to hearing all about it! Have fun!
YurikoYamamoto: Don't forget to share any cool clips from the jam! 👀🎶
WolfgangSchulz: Absolutely! I’ll take some clips and send them your way! Can't wait to catch up next time! 😊
YurikoYamamoto: Looks like you guys are all set! I’m excited to hear how it all went! Enjoy! 🎉
LiHua: Totally! We'll fill you in on all the details, Yuriko! Take care and catch you later! 🎸✨
YurikoYamamoto: Have fun, you two! Can't wait for the next jam! 💖
