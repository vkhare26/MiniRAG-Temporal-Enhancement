LiHua: Hey! Quick question, do neurosurgeons actually use test tubes in their work? Trying to get some insights for a website I’m designing. Thanks!
ChaeSong-hwa: Neurosurgeons usually don’t use test tubes. We focus more on surgical tools and imaging techniques. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
LiHua: Got it, thanks for clarifying! Are there any specific tools that are essential for neurosurgery that I should highlight on the website? 
ChaeSong-hwa: Definitely! Some important tools are scalpels, retractors, microscopes, and endoscopes. Each plays a critical role in performing surgeries efficiently. If you need more details, just let me know!
LiHua: Thanks a lot! This info is super helpful. I appreciate your help with this! 
ChaeSong-hwa: No problem at all! Glad to help out. Good luck with the website!
