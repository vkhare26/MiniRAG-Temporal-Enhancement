LiHua: Hey Chae! I have been seeing some people walking their dogs without a leash lately in the neighborhood, and I totally oppose this behavior. What do you think?
ChaeSong-hwa: I totally agree! Itâ€™s so important for the safety of both the dogs and others. Plus, it helps keep them from running off and getting into trouble.
LiHua: Absolutely! It also shows respect for other people who might be scared of dogs. Leashes can really help with that!
ChaeSong-hwa: Yeah, and it gives us better control over our pets. Some dogs get too excited and might jump on people. A leash can prevent that from happening.
LiHua: For sure! It can help keep both the dog and others calm in those situations. Plus, it's a good way to train them for better behavior too!
ChaeSong-hwa: Exactly! Training them while on a leash can really reinforce their responses. It just makes walks more enjoyable for everyone involved.
LiHua: Totally! And it makes it easier to keep an eye on them when we're out in crowded places. Dogs can be curious and get into things quickly!
ChaeSong-hwa: Right? Especially with all the distractions around. A leash gives us a bit of peace of mind. Plus, it makes the walks feel safer!
