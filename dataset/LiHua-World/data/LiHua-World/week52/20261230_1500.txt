LiHua: Hey my friend! New year is around the corner! What are your new year wishes?
WolfgangSchulz: Hey! I'm thinking of focusing more on my drumming this year. Wanna get back into it like we used to. What about you? Any specific plans?
LiHua: That sounds awesome! I'm planning to really dive into my gaming and TV series this year, maybe even start working on some new music with the band! ðŸŽ¸ What games are on your list to play?
WolfgangSchulz: Nice! I haven't really thought about games in a bit. I might catch up on some classics. But mostly focusing on tightening up my drumming skills! Gonna make our jams even better! ðŸ˜„
LiHua: For sure! Can't wait to jam with you again! I think I'll try to get better at guitar too. Plus, I really wanna hit the soccer field and improve my skills there. Maybe we can even have a little soccer game with the band sometime! ðŸ¥…âš½
WolfgangSchulz: That sounds fun! Mixing soccer and music would be a blast! Let's definitely plan that. Just remind me, no rehearsals on off days, alright? Got to keep Sundays sacred for music! ðŸ˜‰
LiHua: Absolutely! Sundays are all about the music. I'll figure out a day for the soccer game, maybe a weekend? Should be a good balance, right? ðŸ˜„
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, totally! A good mix of fun and music will keep things fresh. Just keep me posted on the soccer plans so I can practice my kicks! ðŸ˜‚
LiHua: Will do! Looking forward to both music and soccer this year. Itâ€™s gonna be epic!
