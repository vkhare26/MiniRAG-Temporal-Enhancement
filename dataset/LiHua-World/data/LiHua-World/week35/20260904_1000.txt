ChaeSong-hwa: Hey Li Hua! Do you know that recent studies find that it is good for babies to listen to music from time to time? It’s amazing how it can help with their development.🎶
LiHua: I had no idea it could be that beneficial! Makes me want to start a little playlist for the kids! 😄
ChaeSong-hwa: Yes! Creating a sweet little playlist would be so fun! Plus, it could set a calming atmosphere for them. Any favorite songs in mind? 🎶✨
LiHua: Totally! I think some classic lullabies might work. And maybe some gentle guitar melodies too. What do you think? 😊
ChaeSong-hwa: Sounds perfect! Lullabies are timeless. Plus, you can always sneak in some of our band’s mellow tunes! 🎸❤️
LiHua: That's a great idea! Our music could definitely bring some joy to them. Can't wait to share it! 🎶
ChaeSong-hwa: Absolutely! It'll be a lovely way for them to experience our music from an early age. Love it! 🎉
