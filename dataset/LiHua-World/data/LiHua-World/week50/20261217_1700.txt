JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua! I think it might be a good idea to dial down the training intensity for this week and next week since your arm is sore. Let’s focus on recovery and some lighter exercises. What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds like a good plan! I appreciate the concern. Let’s take it easy for a bit and focus on recovery. Just let me know what you recommend!
JenniferMoore: Great! We can switch to low-impact workouts and maybe some stretching sessions to help with the soreness. I’ll put together a modified plan for our sessions. Sound good?
LiHua: Yeah, that works for me! Looking forward to the modified plan. Thanks for taking care of this!
JenniferMoore: No problem at all! Your health is my priority. We'll get through this together. See you in our next session!
