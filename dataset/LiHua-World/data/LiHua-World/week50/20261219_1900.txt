WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Just a heads up, I'm off to Hong Kong for a couple of days next week. Anything you want me to grab while I'm there?
LiHua: Ooh, nice trip! Maybe look for some cool snacks or a local souvenir? That would be awesome!
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds good! I’ll keep an eye out for some unique snacks and a souvenir. Anything specific you had in mind?
