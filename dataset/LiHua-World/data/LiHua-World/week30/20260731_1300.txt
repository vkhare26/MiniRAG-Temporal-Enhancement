HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua! 🥖 I'm planning a bread-tasting event at the bakery and would love your help gathering feedback from our customers. Do you think you could assist with that? It would mean a lot! 🎉
LiHua: Sure! I'd be happy to help with that. When's the event happening? 🍞💬
HaileyJohnson: Awesome! The event will be on Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm. Do you think you can come by during that time? It’ll be a lot of fun! 😄🥳
LiHua: I can definitely make it! Just let me know what you need me to do. Can't wait! 🎉
HaileyJohnson: Great! I’ll probably need you to chat with customers and collect their thoughts on the different breads. Maybe even jot down some favorites! Sound good? 😊📋
LiHua: Sounds perfect! I’ll bring my notepad and we’ll make it a fun day. Looking forward to it! 🍞🎶
HaileyJohnson: Yay, I can't wait! Thanks so much for helping out! It’s going to be a blast! If you have any ideas for the event, let me know. 🌟🥳
