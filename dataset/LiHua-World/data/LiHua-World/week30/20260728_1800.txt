WolfgangSchulz: Hey Li Hua! ðŸ˜Š I was thinking we could pick up a new hobby together to unwind a bit from work stress. How about pottery or painting? Sounds fun, right? ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
LiHua: That sounds like a great idea! Iâ€™ve been wanting to try painting for a while now. What do you think, should we start there? ðŸŽ¨
WolfgangSchulz: Painting it is then! We can explore some techniques and just have fun with it. ðŸŽ¨ When do you want to get started?
LiHua: How about this weekend? We can gather some supplies and spend the day painting together! ðŸ˜Š
WolfgangSchulz: This weekend works for me! Letâ€™s make it a fun day. Canâ€™t wait to see what we come up with! ðŸŽ‰
LiHua: Same here! It'll be a blast! ðŸ¤— Letâ€™s plan to meet at my place and we can set everything up. See you then!
