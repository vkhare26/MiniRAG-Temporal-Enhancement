ChaeSong-hwa: Hey Li Hua! Remember last time I told you that I was under a lot of stress because of my research been stucking for a while?
ChaeSong-hwa: I'm happy to share with you that my team and I have finally made some progess!
LiHua: Oh wow! Awesome to hear about your progress! I'm so proud of you!
ChaeSong-hwa: Thanks! It feels great to see some progress finally. Itâ€™s been a tough ride. Iâ€™m hoping to keep the momentum going. How are you doing? Hope everythingâ€™s good on your end!
Li Hua: I'm doing well, just juggling some freelance work. Also excited for our jam session this Sunday! Got any new ideas for songs?
ChaeSong-hwa: Glad you're doing well! Yeah, I'm looking forward to Sunday too. I was thinking we could try out a few classics, maybe some new stuff we haven't played yet. What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds great! I'm always up for some classics. Any specific songs you have in mind? Letâ€™s make it a fun session!
ChaeSong-hwa: How about we mix it up a bit? Maybe include some Fleetwood Mac? And we could also try something from the current charts! What do you think?
LiHua: Love the idea! Fleetwood Mac always brings good vibes. I'm down for a mix of old and new. Let's rock it! ðŸŽ¸
ChaeSong-hwa: Perfect! Can't wait to jam together. It's always a blast with you guys.  Should we set a time to meet up before the jam?
LiHua: Yeah, good idea! Maybe we can meet an hour earlier to go over the songs? That would give us time to get comfortable with everything. What do you think?
ChaeSong-hwa: Sounds like a plan! Meeting an hour early works for me. Letâ€™s make sure weâ€™re all set to have a great time! 
LiHua: Absolutely! Looking forward to it! Iâ€™ll bring my new guitar too. See you then! ðŸŽ¶
ChaeSong-hwa: See you! Canâ€™t wait to hear it!
