AdamSmith: Hey Li Hua! Have you thought about which air conditioner you want for the basement? I’m particularly interested in options that are energy-efficient and quiet. Any suggestions?
LiHua: Hey Adam! For energy efficiency and low noise, I recommend looking into inverter AC units. Brands like Mitsubishi and Daikin are known for being quiet and efficient. The SEER rating is also important, aim for 16 or higher. Let me know if you need more help!
AdamSmith: Thanks for the tips! I’ll definitely check out those brands and the SEER rating. Do you have a preference between wall-mounted and portable units? 
LiHua: I think wall-mounted units are better for space-saving and quieter operation. Plus, they usually cool more effectively. Portable ones are good if you need flexibility, but they can be a bit louder. What do you think?
AdamSmith: That makes sense. Wall-mounted sounds like the way to go then. I’ll look into some options that fit those criteria. Appreciate your help!
LiHua: No problem, happy to help! Let me know what you find!
