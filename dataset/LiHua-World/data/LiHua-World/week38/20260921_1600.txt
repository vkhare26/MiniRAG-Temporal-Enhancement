LiHua: Hey Adam, hope you're doing well! Can you help me out with installing a curtain on the basement window? I think it would really boost the privacy down there. Thanks!
AdamSmith: Sure, I can help with that! Just let me know when you're free to get it done.
LiHua: Awesome! How about sometime this week? Just let me know what works for you.
AdamSmith: I'm free on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon. Which one is better for you?
LiHua: Thursday afternoon works for me! Let’s plan for that.
AdamSmith: Sounds good! I’ll bring the tools, and we’ll get it done. Looking forward to it!
LiHua: Thanks, Adam! See you on Thursday!
