JakeWatson: Hey Li Hua! I remember you are kind of confused about the rules of offsides last time. So let me explain it to you.
JakeWatson: So, about offsides – it's basically when an attacking player is ahead of the last defender (excluding the goalie) at the moment the ball is passed to them. It can be a bit tricky, but it helps keep the game fair and exciting. Can't wait to show you this stuff on the field! ⚽️
LiHua: Totally get it! Offside can really change the game flow! Looking forward to practicing together. Let’s see how it goes on the field! ⚽️💪
JakeWatson: Exactly! It’s all about timing and positioning. We’ll have a blast practicing! Just let me know when you're free and we can hit the field. Ready to kick some goals! ⚽😄
LiHua: Sounds good! I’ll check my schedule and let you know when I'm available. Can't wait to get out there and play! 🥅⚽️
JakeWatson: Awesome! Just hit me up whenever. It's gonna be fun introducing you to more soccer tactics while having a good time. Let's keep this energy going! ⚡️⚽️
