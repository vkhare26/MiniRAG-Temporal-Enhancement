WolfgangSchulz: Hey! You up for some stand-up comedy tonight? Could be fun!
LiHua: Sounds awesome! I've been needing a good laugh. What time do you have in mind?
WolfgangSchulz: How about we catch the 8 PM show? Should give us enough time to grab some food first! What do you think?
LiHua: Perfect! Let’s meet a bit earlier then to eat. Any place in mind?
WolfgangSchulz: How about that little pasta joint we love? They have great carbonara!
LiHua: Yes! Love their carbonara. Let’s meet there at 6:30 PM then?
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds good to me! Looking forward to it! 🍝😂
LiHua: Me too! It's gonna be a great night! 🎉 See you later!
