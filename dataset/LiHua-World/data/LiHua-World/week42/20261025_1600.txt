WolfgangSchulz: Oh man, I've seen some stunning places in Europe! The fjords in Norway are breathtaking, you can’t beat those views. Have you ever thought about the lavender fields in Provence? They're like a sea of purple! 🌸✈️
LiHua: Totally! The lavender fields are such a vibe. I've also heard the beaches in Amalfi Coast are unreal. The colors of the water against the cliffs are just next level! 🏖️💙 What’s your favorite place?

WolfgangSchulz: I had the best risotto when I was in Venice. It was creamy and had seafood in it, just perfection! And you know how I love anything with seafood. 🍽️🌊
LiHua: Seafood risotto in Venice sounds heavenly! I’ve always wanted to try authentic Italian food straight from there. Speaking of which, have you thought about planning a trip back to Italy? 🌍✈️
