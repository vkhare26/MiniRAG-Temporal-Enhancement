LiHua: Hey Jennifer! Sorry for the last-minute change, but I have an unexpected work meeting tomorrow. Can we reschedule our training session to Friday instead? Let me know if that works for you. Thanks!
JenniferMoore: No worries at all! Friday works for me. What time are you thinking? Let's make sure we crush that session! ðŸ’ª
