LiHua: Hey! I decided I need to get a guitar this afternoon. Want to join me? It'll be fun! ðŸŽ¸
WolfgangSchulz: Oh, that sounds awesome! I havenâ€™t been out to check out music gear in ages. What kind of guitar are you thinking about? 
LiHua: Iâ€™m not sure yet, maybe a good acoustic? I just want something that feels right. Want to hit a couple of stores together? ðŸŽ¶
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, letâ€™s do it! Trying out a few could be cool. I canâ€™t wait to hear your plans for jamming with it!
LiHua: For sure! I can already picture some jam sessions! ðŸ˜„ Letâ€™s meet up around 2?
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds good! Iâ€™ll see you then!
