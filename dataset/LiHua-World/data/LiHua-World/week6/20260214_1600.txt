LiHua: Hey Jennifer! Quick question for you. What's your opinion on the best type of protein supplement that could help me with my fitness goals? Thanks!
JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua! For your goals, I’d recommend looking into whey protein. It’s great for muscle recovery and building lean mass. If you’re looking for something plant-based, pea or rice protein can also be good options. Just make sure you check the ingredients for added sugars or fillers! 💪✨
LiHua: Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely look into whey and maybe the plant-based options too. Do you think it's better to take it before or after workouts?
JenniferMoore: After workouts is generally better! Your muscles are primed to absorb the protein for recovery. Just try to have it within 30-60 minutes post-workout for the best results. If you have it before, just keep it light. Remember hydration is key too! 💧😊
LiHua: Got it! I’ll focus on post-workout for sure. Appreciate your help! Excited for our next training session! 💪😄
JenniferMoore: Can’t wait to see you! Let’s crush it together on Tuesday! 🏋️‍♀️✨
