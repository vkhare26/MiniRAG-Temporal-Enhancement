LiHua: Hey Jennifer! I've been wanting to add some flexibility and balance work to my routine. I think it would be very helpful for my overall fitness goal. What do you have in mind?
JenniferMoore: Hey! I'm thinking of incorporating some yoga and dynamic stretching techniques. These will really help improve flexibility and balance. We can start with a few sessions next week! What do you think?
LiHua: Sounds awesome! I'm really looking forward to it. I think itâ€™ll complement my current workouts nicely. What days are you thinking for the new sessions?
JenniferMoore: How about adding them on our regular days? We can focus on flexibility for a bit after our strength training on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Does that work for you?
LiHua: That works for me! I'm excited to start this new routine. It'll be a nice change of pace. Thanks for the suggestion!
JenniferMoore: No problem! Can't wait to see how it helps you improve. It's gonna be fun!
