YurikoYamamoto: Hey Li Hua! Just wanna tell you that I had such a rewarding session this week! The little one is really making progress with their stammer. Itâ€™s so heartwarming to see them gain confidence. I'm trying some new techniques, and they seem to respond well. Can't wait to see how they'll do next week! ðŸŽ‰
LiHua: That's amazing to hear! It's really impressive how you're helping him gain confidence. Those small victories make such a big difference in their lives! Keep up the great work! ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Š
YurikoYamamoto: Thanks! It's really fulfilling to see the changes happening. Each session feels like a step forward. I hope I can keep finding new ways to support them. How's everything on your side?
LiHua: All good here! Just busy with work and balancing fitness stuff. I've been hitting the gym with my trainer, and itâ€™s been intense but fun! Also, looking forward to our jam session on Sunday! What have you been up to outside your sessions?
YurikoYamamoto: I've been reading some psychology books lately, trying to learn more about different approaches. Itâ€™s fascinating! And, of course, playing bass helps me unwind after a long day. Excited for our jam too! Any songs in mind for Sunday?
LiHua: That sounds awesome! I'm all in for playing some classics. Maybe we could try something different this week?! I've been thinking about incorporating a fun groove into our set. What's your thought on that?
YurikoYamamoto: I love that idea! A fun groove would definitely spice things up. Letâ€™s brainstorm some songs that fit that vibe. We could really get into it! ðŸŽ¶
LiHua: I canâ€™t wait! This is going to be so much fun. Let's bring some energy! Maybe we can ask Wolfgang for some ideas too. What do you think?
YurikoYamamoto: Definitely! Wolfgang has a great ear for rhythm and can suggest some cool tracks. Letâ€™s collaborate and see what we come up with. The more, the merrier!
LiHua: Absolutely! Letâ€™s bring the Jolly Band vibe to a whole new level! Friday's almost over, so Iâ€™m looking forward to our weekend jam. See you soon! ðŸŽ¸âœ¨
