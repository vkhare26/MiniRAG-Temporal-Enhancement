LiHua: Hey guys! I'm recently watching some classic games between Barcelona and Real Madrid! I must say, they are the best football opponents of all time!
JakeWatson: Yeah, remember that legendary match in 2014? The one where Barça crushed Madrid 4-3? What a rollercoaster! Messi's insane goal at the end was just epic! What are your thoughts on it?
Giselle: That game was something else! Both teams went all out. I loved how Barcelona's pressing was on point. And that last-minute goal from Messi? Just wild! Any other matches that stand out to you?
Ivor: Totally! How about the 2011 Champions League final? Barça vs. Madrid! That 3-1 scoreline was so satisfying, and the way they controlled the game was just masterclass. Xavi and Iniesta were unplayable that day. Anyone else think that was one of the best football matches ever?
Jasper: For sure! That match really showed how dominant Barcelona was under Pep. Their possession play was insane, and the counters were ruthless. I still remember Pedro's goal; he set the tone early. It's matches like that which make El Clasico so special! Got any other memorable clashes in mind?
Farrah: What about the 2-2 draw in 2012? That game had everything! Ronaldo and Messi scoring and even a last-minute equalizer! It's crazy how these two always find a way to make these matches unforgettable. What do you guys think?
Ivor: Definitely a classic! That match had so much drama, especially with both teams trading blows like that. The intensity was through the roof! And seeing both Messi and Ronaldo on the scoresheet was like a dream for any football fan. Such a memorable El Clasico! 
Aurora: I still can't get over the 2017 match when Madrid edged out Barcelona 3-1 at the Bernabéu. That second goal from Cristiano was just a lethal strike. The atmosphere was electric! What do you think about Real's tactics in that game?
Evangeline: That match really highlighted Real Madrid's counter-attacking style. They were so quick to exploit Barcelona's high line! Zidane had them all well-drilled for that one. And the way Ronaldo took his chances was just clinical. It’s always interesting to see how these tactics play out in El Clasico!
Dacey: Speaking of tactics, I’m curious about how the upcoming matches will unfold this season. With both teams changing a lot in their squads, do you think we’ll see a shift in their strategies? 
Farrah: I think the changes will definitely affect their tactics. Barcelona is focusing on younger talent, while Real Madrid is integrating some experienced players. It’ll be interesting to see how they adjust their playing styles in the next El Clasico! Any predictions on who will dominate?
