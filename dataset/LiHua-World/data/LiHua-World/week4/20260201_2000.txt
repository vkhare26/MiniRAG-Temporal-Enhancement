LiHua: Hey Adam! Hope you’re doing well. Just wanted to check if there are any rules about hanging my new artwork on the walls. Let me know!
AdamSmith: Hi Li Hua! I'm glad to hear you're settling in well. You can hang your artwork as long as you don't damage the walls. Just use removable hooks. Enjoy your decorating!
LiHua: Thanks for the info! I’ll make sure to be careful. Can’t wait to show you the finished look!
AdamSmith: Looking forward to seeing it! I'm sure it will look great.
