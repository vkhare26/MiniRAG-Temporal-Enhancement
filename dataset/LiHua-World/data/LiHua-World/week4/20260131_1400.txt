LiHua: Ugh, that client from last week is driving me crazy! 🙄 They keep changing their requirements like every couple of days. It’s so frustrating trying to keep up with their whims! Can’t they just stick to something for once?
WolfgangSchulz: Seriously, that's the worst! It's like they're never satisfied. 😅 Just keep a clear log of all the changes they request. It might help you track what you’ve done and see if you can push back a bit on the constant changes.
LiHua: Great idea! I'll start keeping a log of all their requests. Just really hope they settle on something soon. It's making it hard to focus on my other projects. 😩 Any plans for today?
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, I hear you. It's tough when clients are all over the place! As for today, I'm just chilling and probably diving into some coding later. Thinking of experimenting with a new music app too. What about you? Any fun plans?
LiHua: I might go for a little walk and see if I can find a new café to check out. Need a break to clear my head! ☕️ Plus, who knows, maybe I’ll snap some cool photos along the way! 📸 How's the coding going, by the way? 
WolfgangSchulz: A walk sounds perfect! Fresh air always helps. 🥲 Coding's been pretty smooth lately, actually. Just trying to fine-tune some functions for that new project I'm working on. Got any specific vibes you're looking for in that café? 
LiHua: Just something chill and cozy, maybe with good coffee and some nice vibes! A place where I can relax for a bit and maybe get some work done too. I love those kinds of spots! What about you? Any favorite cafes you’d recommend?
WolfgangSchulz: There's a great little café not far from here called "The Java Spot." Super cozy, free Wi-Fi, and they have awesome coffee! Plus, they play nice background music, which is perfect for focusing. You'll love it! Let me know if you check it out!
LiHua: Thanks for the tip! I’ll definitely swing by "The Java Spot" later. Sounds like the perfect spot to chill and work! 🙌 Enjoy your coding session!
